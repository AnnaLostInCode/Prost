# This file contains user-specific properties to build, test and run the application locally.

# Instructions:
#  1. Copy this file to application-local.properties in this directory (/config/)
#  2. Set the properties to your desired values

# NEVER change and commit this .defaults file!

# Spring Boot will pick up the /config/application-local.properties file as a property source when the local profile is activated (default).
# Properties set here will override the values from other .properties files.
